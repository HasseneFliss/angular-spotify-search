# Angular Spotify Search

A web app that lets you search for songs by artist or title. The app displays artist, track, and album information, and features an audio player that lets you preview tracks. Built with Bootstrap 4 and Angular 5.

## Instructions

Run `npm start` on the command line to start the application. This will run a script that will grab a temporary Spotify API key for you that the app can consume automatically via dependency injection. This command will also start the development server by running `ng serve` automatically.
